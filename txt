I'll create a 5-file structure that balances organization with maintainability:

base.css - Fundamentals: resets, variables, typography, global elements
layout.css - Structural components: containers, grids, sections, navigation, footer
components.css - Reusable UI elements: cards, buttons, forms, modals, tabs
sections.css - Page-specific sections: hero, services, portfolio, equipment, about, contact
theme.css - Visual modifiers: dark mode, media queries, utilities, animations
This structure follows professional principles while keeping files to a manageable number. It separates concerns, makes debugging easier, and allows for better caching strategies.
